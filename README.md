Text Based Adventure Game

A text-based adventure game. 
The player has the ability to move from one location to another.
Some locations may have hazards that damage the player.
If the player can make it to the goal location alive, they win the game.




**NOTE**
The game is a work in progress. Currently there is still some implementation 
that needs to be done with the viewmodel to finalize the first sprint.

Still needed:
Some formatting of hazard info into the location description.
Displaying the gameOver for win/lose
